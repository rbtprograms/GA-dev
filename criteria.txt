## ease of accessing package, help, tests:

Fine.

## main help page (select):

Some things are hard to understand.

Not entirely clear what `log_outcome` does. Only by looking at the code do I see this is whether the user wants the log to be taken within the algorithm.
Parameters not in same order as arguments so hard to read.

One example.

## quality of user interface (function arguments, flexibility):

Why is `chromosome_length` required? You could determine it from `data`.

Also, requiring user to adjust `max_features` is not user friendly. It should default to the number of independent variables.

You should return output to the user to use in subsequent analysis, not just print to the screen.

It looks like you return the best model from the last iteration rather than the best model overall?

Control over the output feels somewhat complicated.

Limited flexibility in terms of user control over GA.

## performance on my tests:

performance on baseball known: finds best model;   12 sec.
performance on baseball full: finds a good model, but not the best;  20 sec.
performance on big-p: can't run GLM

## testing

Limited tests.

Test failure: TypeError: select() got an unexpected keyword argument 'exit_condition_scalar'. It looks like the test file is truncated.

## writeup (including examples):

Clear and detailed.

One basic simulated example and one additional example. No assessment of whether a good model was obtained for the crime dataset. No comparison with Lasso-selected models.

## code efficiency

Ok.

It looks like you recalculate fitness unnecessarily when elitism is used.


## code organization/clarity/elegance:

Ok, though I found some of the variable made it hard to follow what was going on.

Code for selection/child generation somewhat hard to follow. 

I don't understand the convergence criterion. Why do you check if `g=100` and where do you assess "if the maximum fitness core in a generation converges" (also I don't understand what that means - what does it mean to converge "in a generation" and how is it assessed?)

## code comments/formatting:

Some additional commenting would help.

## equality of workload:

Good.
